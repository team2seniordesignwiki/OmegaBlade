        <h3>The Story</h3>
        <p>Earth's unbreakable strength. Wind's howling bite. Fire's engulfing rage. Water's fluid embrace.

        The forces of nature, encompassed in an a meteorite summoned forth to strike down an ancient evil. Once the dust settled, the four heroes took the otherworldly metal to the finest smiths in the world and requested a blade be forged for each of them. Rising to the challenge, the smiths created a set of weapons that were unrivaled by any other, bestowing each chosen hero with a sword fitting their strengths.<br>

        For Veridian, the α-blade, quick and light as her feet.
        For Clayton, the β-blade, heavy and thick as his will.
        For Azura, the Δ-blade, smooth and fluid as her speech.
        For Ross, the γ-blade, sharp and fierce as his attitude.<br>

        And together, their weapons can merge to form something stronger than any of them could achieve alone. The Ω-blade, the end-all. The heroes have long since separated, but they carry their weapons eternally, just in case some evil rises again...</p>

        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>The project is part of a Mobile Active Gaming Environment (MAGE) focused around IR packet transmission using the MAGE IR Protocol (MIRP). The Omega-Blade is the ultimate weapon consisting of four individual blades that have unique attributes. The goal is to have each of the blades deliver either damage or stun IR packets or both. Some of the blades take damage while others are indestructible. The blades have stringent dimensional constraints and are capable of lasting 2 hours. Some swords are light while others are heavy, requiring varying force from the swordsman to release its power. The four swords physically unite so that their powers coalesce to form the Omega-Blade (superset of all four blades).</p>
